    '''
    A local, file-based queue for storing the coordinates of tiles to render.
    Can be used as a drop-in replacement for `tilequeue.queue.sqs.SqsQueue`.
    Note that it doesn't support reading/writing from multiple `tilequeue`
    instances; you *can* `seed` and `process` at the same time, but you *can't*
    run more than one `seed` or `write` instance at the same time. This is
    primarily meant for development/debugging, so adding multi-process locking
    probably isn't worth the complexity.
